# My React Starter Playground

A place for me to slowly build up a starter React project template. Currently
this includes:

- React
- Redux
- Webpack 2 (Working on Beta branches which will need to be updated later)
- Hot module reload for dev environments
- Decently-performant production builds
- Sass 7-1 with BEM styling (newer modular CSS is still weird to me)
- Redux-Saga
- React-Router
